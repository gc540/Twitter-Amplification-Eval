# Evaluating Twitter's Algorithmic Amplification of Low-Trust Content: An Observational Study
### Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered recommender systems play a crucial role in determining the content that users are exposed to on social media platforms. However, the behavioural patterns of these systems are often opaque and non-replicable, complicating the evaluation of their impact on the dissemination and consumption of disinformation and misinformation.To begin addressing this evidence gap, this study presents a measurement approach that uses observed digital traces to infer the current status of algorithmic amplification of low-trust content on Twitter. Using an original dataset of ~ 2.7 million posts on COVID-19 and climate change published on the platform in a 14-day period in January 2023, this study identifies tweets sharing information from domains rated as low-trust by IffyNews (n=74,467), and for each tweet author, it compares the impressions of tweets containing low-trust information against an impressions benchmark generated from the author’s timeline. To minimise the influence of factors traditionally understood to influence impressions - defined as how many times a tweet has been viewed - the data is grouped by tweet author, and the sample is stratified twice, controlling for the effect of tweet-level sentiment and engagement. Through this approach, it is possible to assess whether, for any given user, Twitter’s recommender system amplifies the impressions - and as a consequence, the visibility - of potentially misleading information regardless of critical confounding factors. This analysis provides valuable observational evidence on whether the Twitter algorithm favours the visibility of low-trust content, with results indicating that tweets containing low-trust URL domains perform significantly better than tweets that do not across all sample stratifications. This suggests that in its current form, Twitter’s recommender system may be facilitating the diffusion of false content, even when originating from notoriously low-trust sources.
